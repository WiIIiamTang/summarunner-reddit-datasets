My mother had amassed 30,000 of debt without me knowing and on the day of receiving a surprising eviction notice, she tries to commit suicide by overdosing on opiates (think it was oxycontin/oxycodone and bunch of other shit), I phoned emergency services and essentially save her life.  Well I Have to deal with debt, get all our possessions out of the old house, find a new one, and so on and so forth, you kinda get the idea, but yeah essentially the gist is I have absolutely no money, and because of this and only this reason my entire family now has disowned me and hates the living guts out of me just because I didn't have the money to commute to the hospital every day.
