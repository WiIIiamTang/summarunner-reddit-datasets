I was at a bar in Boston and noticed there was a backpack under my table.  I open it to find a new Macbook pro and a few architecture books with a Northeastern college sticker on it.  Fast forward an hour later and this girl comes through the door walks over to where i was and starts looking all around.. just keeps saying "where is my backpack" over and over..  Saying nothing she PUSHES my girlfriend out of the way and rushes to the bar demanding her backpack.
