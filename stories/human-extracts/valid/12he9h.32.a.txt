When I was in 9th grade, a girl who was a year above and who had once been my friend began to harass me.  I remembered that she had a big crush on Al Gore and I knew that she used Xanga religiously so I tried to log into her Xanga, using Al Gore as the password.  I deleted every single entry she had written.  She had her account for like two years and when she saw what had happened, she made a long post about how heartbroken she was.
