I was in the Coast Guard for 4 years, two of them spent on a 210' Cutter home-ported in NC, so we did a lot of patrols in the Caribbean, and naturally, we passed through the Bermuda triangle frequently.  So one night I'm on helm, in the Bermuda triangle, and the quartermaster asks me for a compass check (where you look in a little window at the magnetic compass reading), and it's spinning rapidly.  When I tried to explain to the QM why I couldn't give him a compass check, the GPS computer suddenly went dead, just simply quit.
