My sister used to work at a Jamba Juice.  One day, a lady came in asking for a smoothie original size.  My sister accidentally made too much and ended up giving the lady a power sized smoothie (one size larger than the original).  " and then proceeded to pour the entire smoothie onto the floor and walked out.
