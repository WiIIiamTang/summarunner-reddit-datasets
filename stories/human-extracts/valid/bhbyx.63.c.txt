There I was, reading my Sesame Street book, all cozy in my bunk bed with my siblings and parents fast asleep leaving me and my imagination awake to entertain ourselves.  The book slid down and fell into the crack between the wall and my bed, so instinctively I reached down to retrieve my lost treasure.  As I was pulling the book up, however, I felt a slight tug on the end of it.  I pulled again, and IT pulled back STRONGER.  The next morning, thinking it had just been a figment of my lovely imagination, I go under the bed to get back my cherished possession... only to find it nowhere to be found.
