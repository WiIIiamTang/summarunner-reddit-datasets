So I am around 11 years old, playing with my friends in the playground outside, when I saw that my mate Chris had fallen over, It was no big deal, he suffered badly from Spina Bifida, and part of that seems to be that his legs would just suddenly give way, as if someone had just turned his legs switch to "Off".  I, being the biggest 11 year old you've ever seen in your life, just below 5 foot and around 130 lbs, went over to help him up, like I always did dozens of other times.  My parents get called, we all sit down in the Head Masters office while I get called a bully, a disruptive influence, a lyer, disrespectful of teachers, and my parents get a twisted worse case scenario that if someone lifts him he could die or some such shit.
