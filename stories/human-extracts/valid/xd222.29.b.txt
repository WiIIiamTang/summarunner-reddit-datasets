A coworker set me up with her neighbor to help him get back into the swing of things following his divorce.  When I met him at the restaurant, he was dressed kinda freaky with tall black boots, a pink button down with the collar standing up, and large hoop earrings.  I called my coworker as soon as I finished dinner and she said that he didn't sound like her neighbor.  He was having some sort of psychotic breakdown and ended up killing himself a short time later.
