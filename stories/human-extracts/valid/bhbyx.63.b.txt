The book slid down and fell into the crack between the wall and my bed, so instinctively I reached down to retrieve my lost treasure.  As I was pulling the book up, however, I felt a slight tug on the end of it.  The book hit the hardwood floor with a THUD and I heard a scrapping under my bed like nails on a chalkboard.  All that was left was a deep scratch in the floor next to where the book should have been.
