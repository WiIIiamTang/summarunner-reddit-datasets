I had hooked up with a girl (who we'll call Sasha) who lived out of town (2 hrs away) and when we went to visit she kept on complaining about her ex-boyfriend (the, don't put a crazy dick in you type).  Being a complete troll I began texting him from her phone (with her permission) basically antagonizing him telling him that 'she was busy getting fucked from behind so she couldn't text'.  Turns out his friend had a Suburban and they were out driving the town looking for us.  They began tailgating us and forcing us to speed up.
