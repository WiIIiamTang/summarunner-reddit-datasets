So, this one time I was cruising with a fully loaded merchant ship, I was a smuggler you see...  As I was enjoying my exploits, my crew and I came upon a castle under siege.  Being the classy fellow I am, I offer all the food in my merchant cog, including a large amount of onions.  For my courageous act I was awarded a knighthood, and land of my own.  He shortened my right hand by removing 4 of my knuckles, as a punishment for smuggling.
