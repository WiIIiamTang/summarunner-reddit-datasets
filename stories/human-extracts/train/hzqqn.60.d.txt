He starts asking me if this is my car and if I knew anything about it being crashed into an ATM outside of my local gas station (btw my gas station was in walking distance and I never drove there unless I needed gas).  We go back to my apartment and the cop starts asking me about my girlfriend, who I figured now that I was somewhat sober had taken my car to get more smokes and had crashed it.
