When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself "The Holder of the End".  Many go mad in that very cell, some disappear soon after the meeting, a few end their lives.  But most do the worst thing, and look upon the object in the person's hands.  Be warned that if you do, your death will be one of cruelty and unrelenting horror.  Your death will be in that room, by that person's hands.
