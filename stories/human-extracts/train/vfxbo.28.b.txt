i had a letter in my mailbox, so i opened it as i tend to do with things i find in my mailbox.  i hadn't realised that the name on the envelope was someone i'd never heard of.  I decided to take a shot in the dark and try the building across the street and found her name in the building directory.  she came down, and proceeded to give me shit for opening her letter.
