I bought a laptop on craigslist, but when I asked if they could lower the price they lowballed me to $80 for the laptop.  I got owner info and did some research.  It was fun to be able to get the machine back to the owner, and so was figuring out the puzzle - But in the end I would have rather had a thank you than the $80 itself.
