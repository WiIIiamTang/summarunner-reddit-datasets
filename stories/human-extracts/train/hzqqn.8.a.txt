When I was twelve, my parents got me a baby green garden snake for my birthday.  A couple weeks later, I walked over to his terrarium to give him his morning meal, to find Salazar in a twisted *S* shape, mouth open, stiff as a twig.  It turns out my best bud in the world was a baby Green Mamba, who had been picked up by accident in Florida (he'd somehow been blown or shipped there in the confusion of a recent hurricane), and then sent to my home state of Cali.
