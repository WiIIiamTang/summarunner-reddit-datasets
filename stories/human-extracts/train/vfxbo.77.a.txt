I used to give rides to my roommate too and from work whenever possible.  I came down with a nasty flu that knocked me on my ass.  I ended up sleeping instead of picking him up from work that night.  The next day, he sends me half a dozen text messages telling me that I have a "severe lack of accountability" and basically calls me lazy, irresponsible etc.
