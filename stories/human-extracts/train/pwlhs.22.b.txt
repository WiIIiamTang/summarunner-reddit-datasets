Here it goes....So I was at work and I had to take the Titanic of shits.  This shit was the size of a toddlers leg.  Flushing isn't an option anymore.  Outside the stall I look in the trash and find an empty Pringles can.  I proceed to scoop the appendage shit.  My co-worker walks in and says "ooh Pringles!  Before I could say no, she grabs the can and puts her hand in.
