We had been friends for a few months by then so I offered to split the rent on a one bedroom apartment so she could handle this court thing.  A few months go by and I realize she is a PIG.  Also when i tried to have a descent grown-ass-people conversation with her about the messiness, late rent, and general craziness of the situation, she slapped me in the face AND BROKE MY VERSACE GLASSES.
