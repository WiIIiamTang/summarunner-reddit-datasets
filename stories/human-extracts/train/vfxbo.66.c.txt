Back in sixth form days we had a leaving do, and while I was there a girl i kind of knew got completely smashed.  I spent that entire evening looking after her, my friends all walked off, and made sure she got home safe.  Return to sixth form for a few days, and everyone thinks i did sexual things to her and treated me like dirt.
