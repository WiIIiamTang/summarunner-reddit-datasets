I once found a mobile phone on the floor on my way to college, and of course as any normal person would i took it, later that day i checked how much it would be worth if i sold it to one of those recycling websites like envirophone, which claimed i could get 50.  I then checked the phone to see if i knew who it belonged to, from pictures etc, turns out it was a kid who lived nearish to me who i didn't know very well.  The kid didn't thank me and still hasn't thanked me to this day, just took the phone on the door step and said something along the lines of 'i thought i had lost this'.
