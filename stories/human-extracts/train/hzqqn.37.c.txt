After I inadvertently outed myself to my parents via leaving my email open, they became kind of batshit insane.  But of course, they also called my grandma to tell her the news (since they ended up having me live with her so I could switch schools, an idea they seemed to think would rid me of teh gey).  My grandma came over and had a two hour long lecture with me about how I'm just obviously confused.  The highlight of the sermon was when this frail, elderly woman told me, "I don't believe you're actually a homosexual.  If you're telling me you are, and refuse to be wrong, then I will go out in the back yard, get a large stick, shove it up your asshole, and you can tell me how much you enjoy it.
