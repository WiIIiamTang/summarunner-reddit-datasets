I helped 2 guys out of a crushed car, putting my life in danger as gas was spilling.  Turns out the car was stolen and the police were on to them.  When the cops and the parents finally come they start interrogating me like I kidnapped her or something.  Another time a guy in front of me at the ATM machine left a full wallet on the machine and walked away.  So I took the wallet into the bank and explained at the counter what happened.  Instead the security guys detain me for like 30 minutes until the owner shows up.
