We get our hair done and show up at the location 15 minutes late.  We hadn't rehearsed inside, so when I walked up the isle to the dais, I didn't move over far enough to leave room for the other 4 bridesmaids.  I had to be told to shuffle down by the next bridesmaid and not only was I completely embarrassed, but the spot I had to stand had a very cold floor vent blowing up my skirt for the entire ceremony.  Boy, did I hear about my screw-up for the rest of the reception.
