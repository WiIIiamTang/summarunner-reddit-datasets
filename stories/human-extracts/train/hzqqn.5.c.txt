I bought a brand new pack of cigs, undid the cellophane from the bottom end, took the pack out, opened it from the bottom, took out some cigs, emptied the tobacco, replaced it with herb, put some tobacco at the end, put the cigs back in the pack from the bottom, closed it and resealed the cellophane.  I reach in and pull out my HEAVILY used, sticky as shit grinder.
