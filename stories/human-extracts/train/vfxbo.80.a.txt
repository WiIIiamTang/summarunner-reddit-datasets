He was not breathing and had no pulse, so I start CPR.  During one of the chest compressions I hear a load crack.  Fast forward 2 weeks while at work on the lifegaurd stand I get approached by this Guy dressed in a nice suit.  I open the envelope to find his mother is suing me for injuring her son during CPR.  That case got dismissed, and we counter sued for defamation, and I got a nice $5000 pay out after months of being called a piece of shit.
