Now this guy had run out of room by the time he had gotten to the truck at the front, and so he went off the road and rolled his car.  The trucks all stopped and my father got out and ran towards the car, which was now on fire.  They get pulled over and my Dad abused the fuck out of this guy because he was still upset about the night before and he sure as hell didn't want to see that shit again, and the guy acted like he had no idea what he did.  I hope that people can understand that trucks, especially road trains, don't have the same capabilities as cars, and you should know how to act around them, and know how they work.
