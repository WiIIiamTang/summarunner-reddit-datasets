It was about midnight we had a fire going and were just sitting around having a good time, then the guy (there was 4 of us) sitting opposite of me yells who are you.  I turn around and there's this man, about 6ft tall staring at us from the edge of the woods with a big rock in his hand.  One guy knocked an arrow in the compound bow we had, the guy across from me grabbed the hatchet and I pulled  the knife off my belt.  He eventually just backed into the woods.
