When I was in the Army, my barracks room mate loaned his car to another guy to drive into town.  The guy tells him "oh your shitty car broke down, so I had to leave it and take a bus back".  The guy couldn't be bothered to TELL Carlos that his car broke down, couldn't even be bothered to make a note of where he'd left it (I dunno, downtown somewhere...), and actually blamed Carlos for his shitty car wasting his time.
