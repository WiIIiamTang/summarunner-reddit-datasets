I used to be an employee at Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle.  After I finish my shift I meet up with my mom and the kids and I decided to take them to the tapir exhibit first.  The zoo's tapirs were a breeding pair and the female was pretty far along he her pregnancy.  My mother starts screaming "OH MY GOD THE TAPIR IS GIVING BIRTH!  I wanted to tell her that the tapir has the largest penis to body ratio of any animal in the world.  I wanted to explain that the tapir was just proudly sprouting a boner for the ever growing crowd to admire, but she wouldn't hear it.
