I had a friend lose his phone in Ottawa/Gitineau after a night of drinking.  Fortunately a Good Samaritan had found it and answered our call.  Unfortunately one of our group had a bit too much to drink and grabbed the phone from Mr. Lost Phone and starts creaming into it "You fucking thief!  When I find you I'm gone kick your ass.
