So after a while my boyfriend "J" decided to search through his stuff found the reminants of the cigars along with a glass pipe that J got me for my birthday.  Fast-forward  a few years later we give another friend a place to to stay whats he do steals my flippin pipe.  Now I was upset, and both these people having the same name I am convinced people with that name bring bad jou-jou into my life.
