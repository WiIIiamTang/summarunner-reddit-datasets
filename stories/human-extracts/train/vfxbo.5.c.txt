One summer I was walking my dalmatian (Sweet Pea) and there was this Chihuahua loose and it ended up running into my grandmother (who was visiting for the summer).  A few weeks later I see the Chihuahua running loose but with another dog.  So we call the owners at 7:15 AM to let them know their dogs are loose again and in our property to which the oldest daughter starts crying and begging me to "please why do you steal our dogs?
