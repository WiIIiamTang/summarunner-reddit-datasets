When my mom and Lisa were teenagers, they were up on the roof of Lisa's house, and they see a bright light in the sky.  She remembers it all clearly, and she remembers the other 3 times she was abducted after that clearly as well.  Anyway, Lisa tells mom that every time she speaks with them, she comes to understand "the truth" more and more.
