On my way up a lady with some small childeren asked if she could buy some, but she realized she didn't have any money so she asked her husband to run to the car and get some.  While waiting a woman who was "in charge" saw me standing there and started freaking out and telling me to bring the tray upstairs, as if I didn't know where to go, or as if I was stoping to talk to some friends.
