Back in high school, me and some other reprobates were having one of our bi-weekly cafetera chairfights and things got even more out of hand than usual.  Right when one of the noon-hour supervisors came into the cafeteria a chair I had thrown took a weird bounce and smacked into the candy and chip vending machine.  The plexiglass (as it turns out it was) pops out and exposes the entire selection to the open air.
