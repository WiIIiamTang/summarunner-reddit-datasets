I started feeling sick during story time after lunch and raised my hand to ask to go to the bathroom, teacher told me to put my hand down, and shushed me when I tried to protest.  Cue this happening 3 more times or so and after the last one I just proceeded to vomit all over the classroom floor, which was carpeted.
