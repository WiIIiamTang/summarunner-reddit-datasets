When I was about six, a car drove by my house while I was outside on a slip 'n slide with my next door neighbor.  The car slowed down when he got close to me, rolled down his window and started talking to me but he was talking kind of quiet to where I couldnt make out what he was saying, so I walk closer and he asks "dont you go to the school down the street?  Right as the door started to open I feel someone grab me by the collar of shirt and yank me into their arms.
