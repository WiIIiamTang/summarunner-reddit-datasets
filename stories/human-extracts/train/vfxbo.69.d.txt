After stuffing my face, a kid about my age (20-22) came up to me and asked me for some money for some food.  I pull out my wallet, hand the kid 5 bucks, hand-shake with a quick bro-hug, and he starts walking into the fast-food joint.  As soon as I turn around, 3 cops throw me onto the ground, yank the kid out of the restaurant, and detain us.  While in custody they find a lot of weed and some bags on the kid.
