I was traveling back home with my mom from my aunt's house on a warm, sunny afternoon.  While I was sitting in the passenger seat, an object just appeared in the sky a little to our left.  It had the classic saucer shape and was shining brightly because the sun was reflecting off of it.  It just vanishes.
