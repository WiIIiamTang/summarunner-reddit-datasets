I was coming down the stairs into the subway.  As I moved past her, she dropped two of them down the stairs, and I - not thinking about anything but trying to be helpful - raced down the stairs to grab them before they tumbled all the way down.  I gathered the bags up, and as I stood up to hand the woman her bags, with a big stupid grin on my face - i get a open-handed slap.
