I helped 2 guys out of a crushed car, putting my life in danger as gas was spilling.  As I was closing I see a child wondering around crying.  When the cops and the parents finally come they start interrogating me like I kidnapped her or something.  Another time a guy in front of me at the ATM machine left a full wallet on the machine and walked away.  So I took the wallet into the bank and explained at the counter what happened.  Instead the security guys detain me for like 30 minutes until the owner shows up.  I just continue doing good when I can and most of the times it is appreciated.
