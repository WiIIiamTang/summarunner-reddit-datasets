In one week's time, I will contact you again to set up a meeting to return your wallet, which I found on a sidewalk.  We will schedule the meeting at the time and place of my choosing, and this time, it will be convenient for me.  "We'll repeat this exercise every week until you can find a way to be appreciative and politely thank me.  Once I deem your behavior appropriate, you can leave with your wallet.
