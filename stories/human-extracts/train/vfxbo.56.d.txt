My mom found a computer on the playground of the school she works at.  Anyway I managed to locate the owners email from the computer and it turned out it was a lady who worked at a church.  Upon arrival I was brought into a room with the woman, the head priest and some other people.  She as well as the rest of them accused me of stealing the laptop and that it was god's intervention which made me realize my mistake and want to return the laptop.
