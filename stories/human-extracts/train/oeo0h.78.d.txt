My room mate was across the room in his bed doing the same thing and we were both talking about how nice it looked when **bam** I blink and suddenly its daytime.  He had absolutely no idea what I was talking about and I asked him where did the night go and he says "We were both looking out the window looking at the snow when you just got really quiet and didn't say anything when I asked you questions so I assumed you were asleep, but when I looked over you were just staring there with your eyes open looking out the window and actually blinked a few times.
