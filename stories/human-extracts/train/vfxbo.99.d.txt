Anyways, I take a leak, and on the way out notice a chick kind of huddled in a corner.  I used to work security at an all-girls dorm and I had seen girls come in that had been roofied, and that's what it looked like to me.  So, I go out to the cops and hoped they would help, and they were less resistant, but gave me the third degree about it, asking me if I was the one who drugged her, asking the girl if I had hurt her, all this crazy shit.
