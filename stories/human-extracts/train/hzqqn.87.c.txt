As I was rubbing my sore ass, I felt a huge tear in my pants right on the crack line.  Somehow I tore a hole through my pants AND underwear.  My mom must have seen my pair of pants in the trash and thought "wtf is my kid doing wasting his uniform pants" and not noticing the hole, placed it back into my uniform rotation.  The next day, I got through half of the pledge of allegiance before the teacher took me outside and explained how all the other students were staring at my ass.
