as im going over it, it turns and looks at me and its a fucking little dog all white.  i go over it.  i walk over to check on the dog which is visibly shaken but not injured short of a small bleeding scratch on its head probably from a hangar that was holding my muffler on.  The owner shows up after a few minutes and the lady who was stopped in the left lane comes out of her car.
