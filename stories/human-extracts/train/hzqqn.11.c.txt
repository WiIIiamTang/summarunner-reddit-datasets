And what should I find at these friend's house but a SNAKE!  Being the impulsive snake-catcher that I am, I grabbed it.  Then it struck at me, which had never happened before, since I am very much loved by garter snakes.  My parents and their friends came outside since I'd screamed a bit in surprise, and they proceeded to chop off the juvenile water moccasin's head off with a shovel.
