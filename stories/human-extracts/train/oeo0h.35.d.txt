One night my Grandma has a dream about him, he tells her clearly that she is to travel to Europe and bring his remains home immediately.  ) Then later while my Grandma was traveling with my mother (mom would have been about 9) she had a dream about him again.  He tells her not to take their flight and again while everyone is telling her otherwise, she follows his advice.
