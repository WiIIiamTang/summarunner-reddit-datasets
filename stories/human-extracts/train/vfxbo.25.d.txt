So my boyfriend and I just graduated, and were, naturally, receiving some cards in the mail.  My boyfriend received a card from him with no money in it, laughed at the snarky message ("money is fleeting, knowledge is power"), and seemed happy enough.  She and her husband then proceeded to bitterly remark, with the biggest eye-rolls possible, that, since the grandpa had decided to help pay for my boyfriend's college education, they GUESSED that made up for it.
