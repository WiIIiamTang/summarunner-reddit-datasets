I stop and walk up to the car to see if they need help (I'm an EMT), I shine my light in the back seat to see a man slumped over apparently asleep.  While on the phone I walk back to my truck to get my go-bag, as I'm on the phone with dispatch, she asks me to get a license number for the car just as a PG&amp;E (power company) cherry-picker truck comes rumbling down from up the closed road.  I move to go around the truck to get the plate number, and the car is gone.  I talked to the driver of the truck and he said there was a 80 foot tree down across the road, and that he didn't think it'd be open for a day or so.
