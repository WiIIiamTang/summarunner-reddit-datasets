So I was sitting on my front porch with this girl who lived down the block.  We were hooking up after I had recently broken up with my psychotic drug addicted ex girlfriend for cheating on me.  So this silver car rolls by that I recognize as her (the ex's) friends vehicle, and WHILE ITS ROLLING BY MY HOUSE the back door opens up and out rolls my screaming crying psycho ex.  The bitch hits the concret at 10 mph and then jumps up with a baseball bat and starts screaming that shes gonna kill the other chick.
