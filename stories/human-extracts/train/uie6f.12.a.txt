About 13 years ago my sister (young teen at the time) started dating her first boyfriend (kid was 19).  He was completely obsessed, would verbally abuse her, etc etc.  So my friend and I took out my friend's aluminum baseball bat out of the trunk, tuned up the kids car a bit and, when he came outside, took one good swing to his legs.
