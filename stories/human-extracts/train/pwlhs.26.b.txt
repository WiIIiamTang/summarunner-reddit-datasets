The day before we left my stomach started to feel a little queasy, but as I was not in a situation to deal with the problem, I gritted my teeth and waited.  Over an hour later I can finally access the bathroom, but i have some 100 yards between it and me.  15 feet from the door everything went to hell.  About an hour later I walk out of the bathroom wearing pants that were not my own.
