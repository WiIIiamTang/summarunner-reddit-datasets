Now this guy had run out of room by the time he had gotten to the truck at the front, and so he went off the road and rolled his car.  The trucks all stopped and my father got out and ran towards the car, which was now on fire.  " What he had seen was the man, still conscious, flailing about in the car, burning alive.  Dad didn't want to see something so horrid that so he didn't look, but he was still haunted by the fact a man was alive one minute ago, driving past him, but was now in the burning car he saw ahead.
