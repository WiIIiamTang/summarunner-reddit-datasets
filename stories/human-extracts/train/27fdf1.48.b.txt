Too late to the party, but I was walking home from the bar and I stopped at what I thought was a safe spot to squat down and do a pee in the bushes.  Obviously I had scoped out the spot poorly because not half way through my pee I looked up to my left and about 10 feet away was a homeless man.  He then told me he had been following me for the last six blocks at which point I cut the stream and pulled my pants up and started to walk swiftly to my house and then he said something referencing his genitals and I started to run.
