He bought a copy of Microsoft Office 2007 from Tigerdirect, but when he got the box, there were two boxed copies of Microsoft Office.  He called them up and told the customer service rep that he had received two copies, and only paid for one, so he wanted a shipping label to send the second one back.  He eventually got a manager on the phone and they accused him of stealing the second copy and they were going to charge him full retail unless he paid to send it back, or at some point they were going to charge him and wouldn't refund him until they received it (again, with him paying shipping).  Anyways, he orders from Newegg now, like the rest of us that prefer decent customer service.
