When I was around 20, a few years ago, I kept having dreams about a woman with long black hair named Aroura [ pronounced A-roar-uh) .  I'm about to pull out and merge onto a highway when I get a phone call from a random number, so I stop the car but no one answered.  Second they get on the highway, some silver civic loses control of their wheel and crashes into the car that swerved in front of me.  It 100% would of been me if I hadn't of got that phone call.  "Hi, you've reached aurora, please leave your name and number.
