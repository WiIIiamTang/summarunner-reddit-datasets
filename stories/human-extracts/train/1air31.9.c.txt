I went out of town for my best friends wedding in which I was a bridesmaid.  I didn't take my boyfriend at the time as per request of the bride.  He overdosed on Valium and told me he was wandering around outside.  Come home to find my blinds torn, DVD player smashed, cooking oil spilled all over my kitchen floor (that HE made me clean up because apparently it was my fault he knocked it over while I wasn't even in town) and my entire nail polish collection (over 50 colors) destroyed, I'm still finding cracked bottles, it's amazing how I haven't died from all those fumes.
