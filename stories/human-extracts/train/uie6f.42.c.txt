At a young age, probably 6,7 I was exposed to sex very early in terms of incest (an Ask reddit thread is never complete without an incest post.  Plan for my father was poisoning, I decided that poisoning wasn't the way to go and he needed to suffer, so I put a pin in it.  So around 4 he was walking to the locker room i was following him, he entered and i entered and I immediately grabbed his head and smashed it against the wall, he was still awake but disoriented, I took out a knife ready to slit his throat but then I heard people walking and talking, I got scared and blitzed out of there.  I am better now, haven't seen that guy in months and I am over my dad.
