Once i was travelling up north and came up behind a car that was going at a steady pace but waving in and out of the lanes.  Me and my partner had a guess that , the driver was going sleepy and we tried our best to catch up along the car.  We noticed tha car had the CB antenna sticking up and were able to get the particular person on CB.  We were able to jog awake the person and convince him to take a break.  The driver was a doctor who was going upstate to attend a call.
