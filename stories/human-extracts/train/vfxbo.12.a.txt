I was on the bus and noticed some guy on his blackberry, dozed off for a few minutes and woke up and noticed the guy left his phone on the bus.  Checked his facebook and saw he updated  his status from home saying some thug on the bus robbed him he also said how horrible people are in Los Angeles, how its a city filled with thieves and shit.
