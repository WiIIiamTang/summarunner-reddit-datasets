He'd driven off, but the drive-thru gave me access to hang half my body out the window and hold up/wave his wallet in the air.  Immediately he began shouting (He's about 6', so he's got my attention) and accusing me of stealing the wallet.  I kept it in a ponytail, which he yanked just hard enough to get a tear-jerk reaction from me.  Before I know what's happening, I'm turning around and I punch him in the nose.  The rule was that the case would be dropped if I was fired, and my employer agreed to this.
