Well I was asked(more like demanded) to carry a tray of food upstairs, I obliged slightly frustrated because I was in the middle of helping a friend find someone.  While waiting a woman who was "in charge" saw me standing there and started freaking out and telling me to bring the tray upstairs, as if I didn't know where to go, or as if I was stoping to talk to some friends.  At this point someone else came to me to take the tray, implying I was too useless to do a simple task.
