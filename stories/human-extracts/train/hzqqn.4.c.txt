Somehow my uncle had a handgun there which is highly illegal, he got drunk and was firing off some rounds in the air.  My parents freaked out and when my uncle was not looking, my mom got the unloaded gun and hid it in her luggage.  She successfully smuggled out a handgun from Mexico to the United States.
