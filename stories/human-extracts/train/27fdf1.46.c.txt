So me and my friend decide to go explore this old group of houses (probably from 1930s) anyway the main house has three stories and is so overgrown a fully grown tree is blocking the door.  When we went to the attic there was a single chair sitting facing out of the only window in the attic.  So I'm superstitious and am scared shitless but my friend sits down in the fair and realizes that it's placed facing the roller rink across the highway....pretty creepy.
