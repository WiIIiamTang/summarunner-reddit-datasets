Well, before I'd sent it to her some random person on a throwaway messaged me my full name and a link to my facebook account.  I'd never shared my account name with anyone, and my posts had no personal information.  It creeped me the heck out, I deleted the account, made a new one with a username similar to the old one, messaged the girl I was sending stuff to, sent her the shipping details and explained why I had a new account and deleted that one.
