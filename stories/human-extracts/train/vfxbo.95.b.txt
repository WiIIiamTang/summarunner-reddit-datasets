When I was about nine years old, I was spending a week at horse camp with a group of other girls, all older (pre-teens/early teens) than one except for one who was about six.  I started back early, and noticed a blood trail heading from the biggest pen toward the tables.  The youngest girl was laying on one with her head split open and the other girls looking at her.  I asked what happened and it turns out they'd played tag blindfolded in the pen with the biggest, wildest horses.
