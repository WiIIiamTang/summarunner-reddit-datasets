When I noticed one of my friends was getting beat up, I jumped in to save him and thus got the shit kicked out of me by a number of coked out gentlemen.  In the midst of the chaos and between consciousness/drunkenness I managed to get the pocket knife out of my pocket and I latched on to the nearest fucker I could get my hands on, I ended up on the back of the biggest guy and I slashed across his neck.  They charged me with attempted manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon.  I took a deal and did 395 days in a medium security state penitentiary.
