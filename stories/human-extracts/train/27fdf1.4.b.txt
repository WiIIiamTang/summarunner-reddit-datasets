One weekday night, I stepped out on our front porch to smoke a cigarette or two (I was up late studying).  She got in her apartment and barely got the door closed before some guy, who came out of nowhere, knocked on her door.  I made a point of being loud with my textbook so he would know I was there and he disappeared as eerily as he had come.  Guy turned out to be a serial rapist who followed lone girls home from bars and pretended to be a cab offering them a ride.
