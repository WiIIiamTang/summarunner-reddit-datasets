I LOATHED this kid on the schoolbus named "Pete" would smack me on the back of the head even though I would mind my own business.  One day I got fed up, when we exited the bus I found a huge stick and started chasing Pete.  he ended up running into the middle of an intersection and getting hit by a white SUV.
