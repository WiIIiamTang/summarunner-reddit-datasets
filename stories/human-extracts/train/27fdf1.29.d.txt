Pull onto the bridge and there is a car waiting on the other side... At first we thought nothing of it.  As we are almost across the bridge we see that the person waving his white glove has an expressionless mask on... Needless to say, we freak the foooook out as we have to slowly weave around the car and stare face to face with the person still waving.
