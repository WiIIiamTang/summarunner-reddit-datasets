My teacher said that a better analogy of America is a "tossed salad" because of how different groups tended to cluster together ala Chinatown.  After the teacher said this, one girl spoke up and said "Oh, I get it.  A tossed salad is better because you can just pick out the things that you don't like.  She realized what she said a few seconds later and apologized profusely saying that is not what she meant.
