I saved my (at the time) best friend from a heroin overdose by sticking suboxone under her tongue, which I miraculously had with me a small piece of at the time (was prescribed to it in recovery as part of my medication assisted treatment).  About a month later her and my boyfriend who I had been living with for two years hooked up.
