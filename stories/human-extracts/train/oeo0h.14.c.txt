I got my wisdom teeth out in 2000 right around the time that the original Matrix came out on VHS.  A little bit after the black cat glich in the matrix scene, I passed out and apparently slept for about eight hours.  I woke up and the movie was at roughly the same spot as when I passed out, but it was completely dark outside.  Zero time lapse for me.
