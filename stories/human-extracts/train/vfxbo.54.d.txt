Winter Formal was coming up and a girl I'd known since 5th grade asked me to be her date, because her and her boyfriend had split about a month before, and she said that he wouldn't care.  Apparently after I agreed to go with her she called her ex and told him I asked her to the dance.  She knew he would get jealous and come back for his lady.
