Once, when I was eight or so, I was at an aquarium where they were hosting a dolphin show.  The trainers tossed a bunch of beach balls into the audience, and the kids that managed to snag a ball from the ground could go up on stage and touch the dolphins and shit.  I managed to grab one of the balls, but there was this younger kid who also wanted it, so, being Good Girl Galbinus, I gave it to her.
