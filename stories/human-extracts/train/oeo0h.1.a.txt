When I was around 20, a few years ago, I kept having dreams about a woman with long black hair named Aroura [ pronounced A-roar-uh) .  Fast forward a few years later, Halloween 2009, I'm in the car with a friend stopped at a gas station.  There was a person behind me who grew impatient, honked at me, and then swerved in front of me instead of waiting for 2 seconds for me to move.  Second they get on the highway, some silver civic loses control of their wheel and crashes into the car that swerved in front of me.  Turns out the drivers of both cars died.  Called it back a few hours later out of gratitude and curiosity, rang 3 times and went to voicemail.
