After stuffing my face, a kid about my age (20-22) came up to me and asked me for some money for some food.  I pull out my wallet, hand the kid 5 bucks, hand-shake with a quick bro-hug, and he starts walking into the fast-food joint.  As soon as I turn around, 3 cops throw me onto the ground, yank the kid out of the restaurant, and detain us.  **This is where they begin to tell me that they're going to find the bag I dropped outside and proceed to pull out a bag from the kid's weed bag, look at each other and laugh.
