I was on a wildfire just south of Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah.  Eight black military choppers escorted us in formation for like ten miles, we assumed they were just doing drills and using us for fake target practice or something.  A good five minutes later an aircraft like nothing I have ever seen flew by us at maybe five hundred feet.  After that some military personnel got on our radio frequency and instructed us to leave the area immediately, when our crew chief asked who it was and why they signed off and the Incident Commander (the guy in charge of managing the entire situation) came on the radios and said we were evacuating the area.
