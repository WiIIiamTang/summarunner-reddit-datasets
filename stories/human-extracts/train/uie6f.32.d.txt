The day I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, who had some mental issues (literally in and out of mental hospitals, etc.  She claimed I beat her, raped her, tortured, and abused her.  She eventually cracked and confessed to an investigator that she'd only done it because if she couldn't have me anymore, then I couldn't have anyone else ever.
