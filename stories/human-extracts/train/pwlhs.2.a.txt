There were a shitton of people in the bathroom, and for some retarded reason I decided to use my umbrella I had because it was raining, and I figured the rain would wash it away when I got outside.  When I went outside my aunt grabbed the umbrella, which was the only one we had, and yelled at me for taking so long and opened it up.  Small pieces of my feces flew on my entire family like we were gingerly coated with brown pepper.
