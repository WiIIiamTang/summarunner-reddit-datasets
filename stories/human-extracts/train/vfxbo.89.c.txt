We helped her get good interview clothes, get a good job at Home Depot, get her kids into both head start and therapy(they are both disabled) and helped her buy a house and move out.  As she left, taking everything not nailed down, she accused me of abusing her children and almost had me beat up.  We lost the house we were renting because of her, and were homeless once again.
