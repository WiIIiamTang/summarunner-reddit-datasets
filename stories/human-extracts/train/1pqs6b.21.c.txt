I've been trucking in the oilfield for 2 years now.  I narrowly avoided a head on collision with a single prop plane,  had a brake pod blow off a truck in front of me and fire past me at an insane speed,  seen a coworker go into a ditch during a blizzard and jump a lease road and get a good 10 feet of air,  fully loaded 40 ton unit do a complete 360 and stay on the road and kept going like nothing happened.  I've gone down a hill jackknife at 70 km/h and some how recover.
