When I was in the Navy, I was standing watch in the engineroom one day.  About halfway through my 6 hour watch, I had to shit, but I didn't want to wake someone up to stand my watch while I pooped.  So I un-dog the hatch (it's a big mechanism, takes a few seconds to open) and lift one leg to get it through - and my colon unloads with a fury unmatched.
