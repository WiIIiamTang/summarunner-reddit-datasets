Back in high school, me and some other reprobates were having one of our bi-weekly cafetera chairfights and things got even more out of hand than usual.  Right when one of the noon-hour supervisors came into the cafeteria a chair I had thrown took a weird bounce and smacked into the candy and chip vending machine.  Everyone in the cafeteria hears this as, "TAKE EVERYTHING YOU CAN!  " and mobs the vending machine, shuffling the poor woman to the back.
