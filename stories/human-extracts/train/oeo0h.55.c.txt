About two years into my relationship with my GF (we'll call her Susan), I had a dream about my ex.  I was in my room (at my mother's house, where I lived at the time) slamming my ex.  I knew I was cheating on Susan, but didn't care.  A few days go by and Susan and I are hanging out in my room.  She brings up this weird dream she had a few days prior, and describes *my exact dream* except from her POV looking through the window.
