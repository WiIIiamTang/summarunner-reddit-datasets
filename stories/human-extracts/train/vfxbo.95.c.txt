When I was about nine years old, I was spending a week at horse camp with a group of other girls, all older (pre-teens/early teens) than one except for one who was about six.  Our trainer had to make an emergency feed run and told us to stay out of the stalls and pens until she got back.  The youngest girl was laying on one with her head split open and the other girls looking at her.  I asked what happened and it turns out they'd played tag blindfolded in the pen with the biggest, wildest horses.  I went to call our trainer on the barn phone but the girls got really mad and scared me away from the phone.  I eventually had to leave that barn because the girls would hurry to leave only the scariest horses left for me to ride in lessons, untie my horses when I was getting a brush or something so I'd be in trouble for a loose horse, make fun of me in general, and let me "help" them by cooling down a horse, only to leave me standing alone when it turned out that horse shouldn't have been under saddle for whatever reason.
