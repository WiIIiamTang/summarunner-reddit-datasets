Anyway, I attended one of the few remaining "invite everyone you know"-style birthday parties for one of my friends from class, and for roughly 40 minutes, off and on, a bunch of the other kids spent their time trying to convince me that Tony Hawk's real name was in fact, not actually Tony Hawk (this was relevant to my interests at the time given THPS2 was, and is, one of the most badass games that has ever existed.  Since I'm not completely retarded, hadn't been known for caving to peer pressure, and genuinely didn't really give a shit, I decided to concede after the seventh or eighth time this topic of conversation came up (amusingly enough, with some of the same people) and it was like the fucking world series was won by the home team, and everyone all reached orgasm in unison.
