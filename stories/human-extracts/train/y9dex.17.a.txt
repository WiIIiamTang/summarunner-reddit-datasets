My sister in law got mad because in one of the wedding photos there is one of me kissing a family friend of 15 years on the cheek because I haven't seen them in a while.  The bitch said it was inappropriate and hasn't shown the wedding photos from the reception to anyone because: "3ll3hciM was drinking at my wedding and ruined some of the pictures".
