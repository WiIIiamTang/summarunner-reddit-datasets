A number of* years ago I was at a party, heavily liquored up, when all of a sudden a fight broke out.  In the midst of the chaos and between consciousness/drunkenness I managed to get the pocket knife out of my pocket and I latched on to the nearest fucker I could get my hands on, I ended up on the back of the biggest guy and I slashed across his neck.
