But when my mom got home she checked the answering machine, and there was a message a few minutes long.  The message was just my grandmother's and my voice laughing hysterically for the whole message.  Like I said the night was normal, and there wasnt a moment when the phone rang, or laughed hysterically for minutes on end.
