I once flew into a foreign country for this woman's wedding since I was a bridesmaid.  They all found you rude and lazy.  Next thing I know, my family and friends are getting threatened and harassed, fake profiles were made with my name and photo, several message boards on Facebook have my name, number, and address up along with the biggest loads of bullshit for any random stranger to read.
