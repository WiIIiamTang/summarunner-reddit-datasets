I was in my room (at my mother's house, where I lived at the time) slamming my ex.  So in the middle of it, I look over to the window (which you can see the back porch from) and Susan is there, watching us, crying and mortified.  She brings up this weird dream she had a few days prior, and describes *my exact dream* except from her POV looking through the window.
