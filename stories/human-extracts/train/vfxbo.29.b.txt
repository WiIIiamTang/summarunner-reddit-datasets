One that comes to mind is he was behind on some money and I let him borrow my netbook to Skype with his wife while he went overseas.  It ended up getting smashed or broken somehow, and he wasn't able to pay me back when he returned.  I also let him borrow my 360 while I was overseas so his kid and him could play since it was just going to be sitting in a garage somewhere.  I never saw that thing again, because evidently it was "stolen".  I managed to get a 100 dollars out of him for my netbook, (it cost around 250) and that was about the end of our friendship.
