After moving in I realized there was something wrong with the lady next door.  I wake up in the middle of the night and see a shadow of a person next to the bed looking at us sleeping.  It's my neighbor and she's holding something in her hand.  When I hear her leave at 2am to go across the road to the 7-eleven I call the cops.  They restrain her and throw her in the van and drive off to some institution and in less than a minute it's like she was never there.
