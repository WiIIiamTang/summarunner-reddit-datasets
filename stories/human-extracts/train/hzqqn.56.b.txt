Somewhere in Scandanavia, I think it was Sweden, the navy uses dogs when they board boats they suspect are smuggling drugs.  I guess the boys didn't like the idea of putting down one of their fellow officers, so Zeus was snuck out of the country and brought to a german shepherd breeder in Canada.  The American military heard about Zeus, and asked the breeder if she would breed him with one of their Mexican border patrol dogs and ship back the offspring.  The breeder said when she got this american dog, it was absolutely out of control, way too aggressive.  When the Americans asked for their offspring, she refused.
