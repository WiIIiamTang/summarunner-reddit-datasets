Pothead was ditching class.  Dad spotted him and gave chase.  Stops, collects jacket, and let's the pothead continue his terror fueled sprint through palmettos and spiderwebs.  Kid charges toward the 2nd story railing and without pause, soars over the edge.  He hit the ground with a fucking stuntman roll, and came out of it running.  Dad didn't even bother trying to find out who the kid was.
