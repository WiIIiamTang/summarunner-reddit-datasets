I lent a very good friend about $500 , his parents were fairly well off and I knew his parents sent him a huge check every birthday because we would always travel right after he got the check (annual $10k gift parents are allowed to distribute tax free to their kids) so I knew I would get it back in a few weeks.  He agreed.  He even went as far as sending me a check on a closed account (stupid because I knew from talking to him the account was closed and he didn't bank there anymore and it had his old address on it from 2 years ago).
