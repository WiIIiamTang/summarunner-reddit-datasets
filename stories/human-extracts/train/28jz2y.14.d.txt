I was an avid poster on /r/ladybonersgw with my throwaway account and amongst the PMs someone said that they never thought that they would see someone they knew on that subreddit.  So obviously I responded with "who dis" and they responded with "oh don't you worry (insert my first name)" I had my suspicions on whom it was but they never responded after that.
