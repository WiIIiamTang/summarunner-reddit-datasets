Once my roommate went in one and found a laptop just sitting in there.  The owner apparently reported it stolen and while my roommate was in class, a police officer went around dorm-to-dorm asking if anyone had seen it.  When he came to our dorm my other roommate answered and said "Oh yeah, it's right here.  Later that day, the cop returned and wanted to know more about how it ended up in our dorm.  The cop took him to the police station and put him in an interrogation room and everything.
