I am nearly finished and she starts complaining that she wanted more of a classic Audrey Hepburn style.  She says I wasn't listening to her and called her mother to come talk sense into me and was almost in tears wondering how she was going to explain her hair to her future inlaws.  Her mom shows and basically tells her that her hair looks beautiful, paid me and dragged her out of the salon.
