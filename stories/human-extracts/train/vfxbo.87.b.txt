There was one guy who had been acting more and more strange as time went by and one of my chiefs asked me to keep an eye on him because they thought he might be suicidal.  I asked him to come over and hang out with me and my girlfriend the first night back - we sat around, watching movies, and they both drank because they were 21.  My girlfriend goes out for a cigarette and some cops show up.  They thought we were drinking underage - I tell them they were drinking at my place and they grab me for minor in possession.  While he and I sat in the drunk tank, he confessed that he was suicidal.
