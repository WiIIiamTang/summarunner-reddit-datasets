I only had my permit so it was dangerous but worth it.  When we were on  our way to a party we were told about, I made a stupid driving error and the one car on the road that barely saw me, was a cop.  The cop asked me for my license, I said I didn't have it(I meant as in at all, he must've thought that I forgot it).  He then asked me and my friends for separate I.D.  He walked to his car and for what seemed like an eternity we waited.  The cop came back, gave me a test to see if I'd been drinking and then told me I could go.
