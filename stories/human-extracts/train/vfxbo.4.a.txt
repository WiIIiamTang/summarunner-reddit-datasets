I captured a pit bull puppy in my backyard when it was chasing some workmen back there, and frankly it needed to not be running loose in my neighborhood.  Took him to the pound-- this was a super-sweet pup, by the way, who totally deserved much better humans.  Then they tell me I shouldn't have done anything with their dog (er... on my property, bothering people...), and how would I like it if someone took *my* dog to the pound?
