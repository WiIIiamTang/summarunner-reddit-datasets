The summer between my freshman and sophomore years of HS I had to have a spinal fusion in my neck, it was from a tumor in my 2nd vertebrae.  Im sitting in Spanish class and the dean for my grade comes knocking on the door and asking for me.  He pulls me outside and says to me So Mr. Modular_Organs, I understand youve been ditching gym class.  Im a little confused, but I politely reply that I had a neck surgery this summer, so I cant go to gym class; I study in the library instead.  The kicker is that during this entire conversation, I have a [halo neck brace](http://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1259&amp;bih=585&amp;q=halo+neck+brace) screwed into my skull.
