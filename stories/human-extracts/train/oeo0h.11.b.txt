As I wait I see an old Guy walking towards the truck with an indescribable look at me as if I know too much.  he stops 5 feet from the truck looks at me for a coupple seconds and heads back the exact way he came.  5-6 years later my dad was showing me home videos of us at Yellowstone.  at old faithful I noticed the same Guy,same look, same clothes peering at us on camera and at me through the TV.
