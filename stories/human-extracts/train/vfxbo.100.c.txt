As we're all leaving that last club, my friends girl starts to freak out in the middle of the street, nearly getting hit by a car and then falling flat on her face.  She then starts crying and screaming that my friend had given her drugs, oh boy.  At the hospital the victim girl is describing what happened in ever growing detail and all this just makes me sick to my stomach, the way she was telling things, the guy i was hanging out with all that time had been a date raper or something.
