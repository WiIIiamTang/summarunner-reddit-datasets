A couple of weeks ago I legitimately tried some trees, and I *hated* it.  I felt out of control, and it took me to a very, very dark place that no amount of awesome TV shows or music could pull me out of, and I couldn't even sleep it off because I was so panicked.  :( More power to those of you that love it and feel awesome, though; doesn't change my opinion that it should be legalized.
