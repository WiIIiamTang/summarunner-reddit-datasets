My ex was a pathological liar - he lied about everything.  He finally arrives at around midnight, saying he has to leave right away to go fix something.  The next day he is tagged in tons of pictures at a bar with coworkers.  Another time I showed up and my toothbrush was missing.  He said my dog ate it and he threw it out, but it ended up being in his closet.
