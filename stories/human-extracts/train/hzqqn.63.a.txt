Quite a few years back, a friend and I had come into possession of several grams of dried 'magic' mushrooms, as well as a handful of LSD blotter tabs.  AND, the whole time, my hand is buried in my back pocket - I had meant to grab my wallet, but once the hand was in there, I sort of forgot about it.  So, naturally, by the time I actually found the water and had returned to the counter to buy it, the poor clerk had assumed I was robbing the place.
