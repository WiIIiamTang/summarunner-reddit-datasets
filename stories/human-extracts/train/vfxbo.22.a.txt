I lent a very good friend about $500 , his parents were fairly well off and I knew his parents sent him a huge check every birthday because we would always travel right after he got the check (annual $10k gift parents are allowed to distribute tax free to their kids) so I knew I would get it back in a few weeks.  I asked him why he would send me a check on a closed account and I got yelled at for "not being a good friend" and not being "supportive of his problems".
