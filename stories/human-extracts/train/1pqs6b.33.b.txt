And in Leeds Utah, we witness a wreck where a lady was weaving between cars going WAAAY too fast for the bend up ahead and hit the guardrail, over corrected and careened off into the ditch and rolled a few times.  She was unconscious and began to choke on her vomit.  My Dad and another guy who stopped pulled her out and laid her on her side and called 911.
