One time I stupidly left my debit card behind at a Walmart.  Luckily the cashier grabbed it and put it in her register.  When I finally traced it back to Walmart, the 2 most unhelpful people ever were working the Customer Service.  Another employee finally called the manager and I nicely explained how much trouble the cashier had saved me by grabbing my card and holding on to it.  He also gave me the cashiers name right away and I wrote to corporate and the store directly saying how much the manager and cashier had gone out of their way to help me, not mentioning the Customer Service people.
