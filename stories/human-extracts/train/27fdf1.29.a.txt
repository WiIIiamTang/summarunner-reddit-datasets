I was driving on some country roads at 1a.m.  We see a white glove waving at us at about half-way to the other side.  As we are almost across the bridge we see that the person waving his white glove has an expressionless mask on... Needless to say, we freak the foooook out as we have to slowly weave around the car and stare face to face with the person still waving.
