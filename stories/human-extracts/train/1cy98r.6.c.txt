So my partner and I roll over we get both parties separated and it's obvious the one driver is DUI, so we hand her off to another officer to be arrested.  And he proceeds to hand us the drivers passengers: four 5-8 year old girls and one full on baby.  Well you'll be shocked to learn that the children of mothers who drive drunk are not the most well behaved little angels.  I could physically see the 'Nope' pass across his face and he drives away without a word.
