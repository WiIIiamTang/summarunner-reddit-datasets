I backed into a girl's car and left a smallish dent, noticeable because of the paint.  I ask her to send me the estimates.  I get them, and there is SO MUCH bullshit on there that I did NOT do, such as a dent on her bumper, the door on the other side of the car being messed up, and even her mirrors being chipped.
