I get a call on a Wednesday which asks if I'm ready to go.  But of course, to his wedding on Saturday!  I was a backup groomsmen and no one had told me.  It was not until the next day that the groom called me and said what a terrible guest I was and that I was no longer welcome in his home.  So after half a week of babysitting and practically running the groomsmen and 500$ later; I was the asshole.
