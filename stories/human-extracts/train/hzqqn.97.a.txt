One night when my friend was working, all of his friends took a bunch of mushrooms and ran through a park.  Well, later that day Jim heard weird noises coming from his closet.  He got my friend to hold a bat and they opened the closet.  Inside the closet was a mentally challenged young boy, about 5 years old.
