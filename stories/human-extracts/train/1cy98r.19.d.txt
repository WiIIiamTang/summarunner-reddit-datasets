Pothead was ditching class.  Dad spotted him and gave chase.  In desparation the kid shucks off his $300 black leather jacket.  Stops, collects jacket, and let's the pothead continue his terror fueled sprint through palmettos and spiderwebs.  Kid charges toward the 2nd story railing and without pause, soars over the edge.  He hit the ground with a fucking stuntman roll, and came out of it running.
