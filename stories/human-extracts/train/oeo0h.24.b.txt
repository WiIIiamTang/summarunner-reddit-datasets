I was walking through Best Buy one day a couple years ago and I walked past a rack of books.  Sitting on the rack was the last book in the Dark Tower series from Stephen King.  I remembered being puzzled about why it was in a Best Buy, but whatever.  I set it down and decided to come back next week after I got paid to buy it.  I went back next week and it wasn't there.  It slipped my mind after that for a bit, but about a month later I went to B&amp;N to get my copy.  They told me it hadn't come out yet, the release date for the book was 6 months later.  When the book actually came out I went to pick it up.  I described the cover out loud to make sure I wasn't crazy.  The clerk handed it to me and there it was exactly as I'd held it in Best Buy.
