the first one: catherine, well we were like BFFs because every weekend i would go to my dads (he lived about 1/2 hour away on a military base) and she was the only person i knew.  after that happened she started to hate me.  (bleh w/e im done with that shit now... i was stupid) ANYWAY, this happened a few more times with different people and i never knew what it was about me that they didn't like.
