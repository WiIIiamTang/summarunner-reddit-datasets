After dodging traffic to pick up her damaged purse with wallet and cell phone we headed to address listed on the license/ID and gave her belongings to her brother and his wife.  We thought that was the end of that, but they invited us to pray with them a month later.  They gave us a bible, a white dress and things got weird when this preacher man came to say the end of the world was coming!
