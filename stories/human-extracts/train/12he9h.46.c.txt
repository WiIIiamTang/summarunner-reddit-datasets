At my old work place, there was a woman who would eat other people's food without their consent.  So everyday after I caught her, some of my co-workers and I would buy a dozen donuts in the morning.  We brought candy and left them in a bowl close to her desk.  Her weight ballooned to unhealthy proportions.
