I captured a pit bull puppy in my backyard when it was chasing some workmen back there, and frankly it needed to not be running loose in my neighborhood.  Took him to the pound-- this was a super-sweet pup, by the way, who totally deserved much better humans.  Fifteen minutes after I get home, they knock on my door demanding to know where the dog is.
