I absolutely HATED their cheesesteaks and did anything to avoid going there for dinner.  One day my dad sent me inside the house with the food while he parked the car, and I took the opportunity to rip some cardboard off a box and put it in my steak.  Undeterred, I began to do this same thing every single time we got food from that place, and eventually my parents were fed up enough to stop going there.
