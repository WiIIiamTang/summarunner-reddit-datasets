Long story short, I get fed up with their crap, their constantly leaving moldy dishes in the kitchen, entering my bedroom and stealing the food in my fridge (that got so bad I had to install a lock on my fridge, then they complained about trust), so I leave with three days left to the month.  They owe me collectively, $700.  One by one, he turns the rest of our friends against me.
