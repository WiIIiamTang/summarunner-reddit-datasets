When I moved to Biloxi about half of my class was black and me being the new student I was asked to introduce myself to the class.  The first thing I said was "Hi my name is yanrogue, I can't believe how many niggers you have here, we only had one in my old school.  " After a very long explanation everything went much better and I learned racism is wrong.
