About a year ago, an online friend's cat ran away.  I vaguely recalled him telling me a long time ago that the cat had run away for three days once, and had gotten stuck in a local barbecue restaurant while it was closed for the weekend.  My friend swears the cat had never run away before, and I could find no record of the supposed "cat ran away" conversation in any of our chat logs.
