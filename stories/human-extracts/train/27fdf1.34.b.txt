One night I am lying on the couch facing the front door and watching the sky through the window by the door when a face shows up in the window illuminated by a lighter.  The person then kicks in the door and walks in the room, he sees me, smiles and goes towards the kitchen.  As he comes out of the kitchen with a knife my dad makes it down the stairs and the guy books it out of there.
