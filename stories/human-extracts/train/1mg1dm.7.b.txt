The 3-hole-puncher kept going missing, then I found out that Barb from the call center was "borrowing" it from my desk to make scrapbooks of her ugly grand kids.  Not long after, a guy from a department adjacent to mine who looked sort of like me hanged himself to death.  When I got back to my cubicle my 3-hole-puncher was missing.  She was mid phone conversation but her jaw dropped and she couldn't speak when she saw me.
