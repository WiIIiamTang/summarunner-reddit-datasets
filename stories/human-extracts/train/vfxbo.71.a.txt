I found a Gucci purse with $300 in it and an iphone on the street.  My gut was right, a few days later, the 'husband' emailed me with angry tone, he said he called the hotel and there was no employee with that name at that hotel and i should return the purse right away.  I guess he is more worried about the phone's content.
