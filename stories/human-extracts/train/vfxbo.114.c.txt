Once my roommate went in one and found a laptop just sitting in there.  He was going to take it to our floor's Residence Adviser, but it was 8:00 am so instead of waking her up, he put it in our dorm so he could give it to her after his classes.  The owner apparently reported it stolen and while my roommate was in class, a police officer went around dorm-to-dorm asking if anyone had seen it.  The cop took him to the police station and put him in an interrogation room and everything.
