To make matters worse, the bride has never seen me in my dress, but she looks at me when I walk in and says "Well, look at you *Barbie*, you're late so you're going to have to get your makeup done *last*" in a very rude tone.  I had to be told to shuffle down by the next bridesmaid and not only was I completely embarrassed, but the spot I had to stand had a very cold floor vent blowing up my skirt for the entire ceremony.
