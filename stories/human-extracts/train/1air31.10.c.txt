She was obsessed with the idea that her BC wasn't working and I had knocked her up.  Then one month she had a really horrible period where she passed a bunch of lining and bled a ton.  She insisted that she had just miscarried our unborn child.  Told all our mutual friends she had miscarried.  She even named her period lining (a male name, because she knew it would have been a boy) and bought a special miscarriage remembrance necklace from some vendor online, so she could always wear it and never forget her poor miscarried uterine lining.
