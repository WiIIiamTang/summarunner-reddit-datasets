My G/F's mothers wedding 2 years ago Her future brother in law was missing for 2 weeks.  He had been shot 2 times and died in a ditch the delivery truck full of packages was gone.  The husband was horrified and told the bride that he cant get married today.She slapped him and stormed out screaming that she cant believe the *HE* could be so selfish that today wasn't just about him and his **stupid brother**.My gf was just as mad ... Me and the husband both left them that day and are good friends to this day.
