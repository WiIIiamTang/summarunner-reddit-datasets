My first car was a classic 1970s vintage two-door coupe.  I offered to give it to the teenage son of some of my parents friends that were struggling financially and couldn't afford a vehicle for their boy.  I found out a month or so later that they sold the car in short order because the teenage son wanted a "fast and furious" type Honda.
