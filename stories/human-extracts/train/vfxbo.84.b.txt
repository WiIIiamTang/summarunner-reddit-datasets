When i was in beauty school I met this girl named Emily.  She threw parties every night and never cleaned up.  They partied all day every day, and guess what!  We got evicted for noise complaint.  Also when i tried to have a descent grown-ass-people conversation with her about the messiness, late rent, and general craziness of the situation, she slapped me in the face AND BROKE MY VERSACE GLASSES.
