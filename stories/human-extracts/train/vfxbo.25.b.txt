My boyfriend received a card from him with no money in it, laughed at the snarky message ("money is fleeting, knowledge is power"), and seemed happy enough.  A few days later, his mom is making a list of everyone who sent him cards.  When the grandpa comes up and she remembers he didn't send any money, she doesn't write his name down.  She and her husband then proceeded to bitterly remark, with the biggest eye-rolls possible, that, since the grandpa had decided to help pay for my boyfriend's college education, they GUESSED that made up for it.
