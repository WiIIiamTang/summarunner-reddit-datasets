I always assumed it was a green mamba, because it was, well, green.  A quick google revealed that black mambas can also be green, and that baby green mambas (such as the one I owned) are in fact YELLOW.  But based on the images I dug up, my little Salazar (he was more olive green, but not super dark) may very well have been a young black mamba.
