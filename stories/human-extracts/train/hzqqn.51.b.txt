A cop walks up to our camp to check in on us, sees a baggy of weed that my friends complete idiot of a wife left out, and just like that they have cause to search all of us one by one, and our tents.  They get to my tent, and I'm about to cry as I hear them unzipping it.  I walk over there, and he pulls me to the side and softly says 'can you tell me what that is?  ', zips up my tent, and *moves on to the next one*.
