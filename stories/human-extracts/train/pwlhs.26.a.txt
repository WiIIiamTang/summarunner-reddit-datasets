When I was senior in high school, I chaperoned a middle school trip for my church, and for a few days everything went better than expected.  Over an hour later I can finally access the bathroom, but i have some 100 yards between it and me.  I couldn't make it.  About an hour later I walk out of the bathroom wearing pants that were not my own.
