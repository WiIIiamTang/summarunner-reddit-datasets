I work a gift shop in a hospital.  Trying to do something nice, I said yes and tossed the check as soon as she left and opened the register to put my own money in.  My boss then walks in and sees me with the register open, money in my hand, and no customer.  She said I had an hour to pack up my stuff and leave and went back into her office.
