I had a tumor on my ovary that was mis-diagnosed, until one day it pretty much started to rupture (or whatever it is that tumors do) and I had to be whisked away, puking blood and all, to the ER.  The whole story is pretty amusing - it even involves vomiting on an old lady at Stop &amp; Shop - but I've been hesitant because I don't have any proof other than the scar on my stomach.
