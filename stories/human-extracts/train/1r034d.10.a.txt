A good five minutes later an aircraft like nothing I have ever seen flew by us at maybe five hundred feet.  It sounds ridiculous but it immediately reminded me of a huge, flying bat mobile, Time Burton era.  After that some military personnel got on our radio frequency and instructed us to leave the area immediately, when our crew chief asked who it was and why they signed off and the Incident Commander (the guy in charge of managing the entire situation) came on the radios and said we were evacuating the area.
