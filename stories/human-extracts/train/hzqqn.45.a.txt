I went to pick up a friend at her house, and was introduced to her new roommate, Tom.  It was a CD of love songs he had written about me on his ukulele and recorded.  The song, unbeknownst to me, was about he and I getting married, inviting all of our friends to our wedding, killing them, and having sex in their blood.
