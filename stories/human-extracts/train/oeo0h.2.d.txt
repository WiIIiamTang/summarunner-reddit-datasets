I called my friend up and he wasn't home so I left a message on his answering machine.  After my initial message that I did leave (as quoted above) there was a slight pause and it continues on for another 30-40 seconds or so with me talking to some girl.  It was my voice, but a conversation I never had with a girl whose voice I didn't recognize.
