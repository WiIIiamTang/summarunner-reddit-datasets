Come 5th grade, we get this young new teacher fresh out of college.  She was openly Jewish, and decided to spend the whole fucking year teaching us about the Holocaust.  Not that it wasn't valuable information to learn, I was just irritated that the program was no longer fun and sciency.  One day before she came in the room, I put a couple dozen photos of Adolph Hitler I had downloaded for a report on her computer, like paintings that made him look heroic and glorious.  For the rest of that semester, she had to look at this slideshow that was basically an artistic blowjob to Hitler whenever she stepped away from her computer.
