Supposedly he had gotten so high from the mushrooms that he had a dream he found a leprachaun and captured it.  Inside the closet was a mentally challenged young boy, about 5 years old.  They didn't want to get in trouble, but they couldn't keep the kid, so they took him to the police and told the officers that they found the kid wandering around.  My friend and his roomate received a $1000 reward for safely returning the missing child to his family.
