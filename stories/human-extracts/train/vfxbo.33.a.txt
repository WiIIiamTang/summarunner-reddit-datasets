Watched a four year old roaming around my store.  He came from the Disney store where I watched him put toys into his backpack and walk out.  He comes in my store and is climbing on everything.  The mom rushed into the store, she was at a phone kiosk outside of the store entrance &gt;( and started yelling "that's why we don't shop at this mall, look how they treat black people!
