We talk until we finish smoking, and he invites me into an expensive bar for a drink.  We all went to a haunted house, they smoked a bowl, and we returned to the bar.  Turns out this guy is a mobster and rich as fuck.  I personally racked up a $1,200 bar-tab that night, all of which the mobster insisted in paying for.
