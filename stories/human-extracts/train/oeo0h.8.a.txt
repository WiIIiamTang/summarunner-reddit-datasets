I was in the hallway for misbehaving, and my neighbor Tad (a year younger than me) came walking out of a class to my right, passed in front of me and headed down some stairs.  About 20 seconds later, he walked out of the same class, passed in front of me, and headed down the stairs.  I never realized how much it was like Matrix deja vu.
