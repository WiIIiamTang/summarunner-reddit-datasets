I was playing on a trampoline with my mates, a game called "Crack the Egg", where one person goes into fetal position as tight as they can while the other bounce around them until the fetus has to unfurl because they get scared or whatever.  So I was the egg, and and somehow I bounced and my right knee hit me in the mouth.  I thought it was my nose but I had actually split the frenulum under my top lip.
