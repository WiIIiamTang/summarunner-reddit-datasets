My dad had this little toy monkey that he used to call his "favorite child" and tease me and my siblings with it.  Well anyways, one day we finally got it and threw it into the garbage after drawing on it and mangling it for a bit.  Anyways, a few years later (when I was about 17), I'm walking down the street in Toronto (I don't live in TO, was just visiting friends) and see this little orange object on the side of the road.
