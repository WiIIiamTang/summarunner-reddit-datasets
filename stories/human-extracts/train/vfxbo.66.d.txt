She could barely stand, vomiting everywhere the lot.  I spent that entire evening looking after her, my friends all walked off, and made sure she got home safe.  Return to sixth form for a few days, and everyone thinks i did sexual things to her and treated me like dirt.  Lost the leaving night and everyone's respect for making sure a girl didn't drown in her own vomit.
