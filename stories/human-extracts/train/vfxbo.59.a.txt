The trainers tossed a bunch of beach balls into the audience, and the kids that managed to snag a ball from the ground could go up on stage and touch the dolphins and shit.  I managed to grab one of the balls, but there was this younger kid who also wanted it, so, being Good Girl Galbinus, I gave it to her.  To this day I am still mad at myself for doing that nice  thing for the little girl, **because I fucking love dolphins.
