When I was in elementary school (the school had roughly 400 students, about 7-12 years old), our teacher got sick so we got a substitute teacher.  So, probably a few weeks later (can't remember exactly how long) everyone on our class of ~25 people had gotten sick of her bullshit, so we decided to make an address demanding that we get a new substitute teacher because this one was bad.  The next day we got a new teacher.
