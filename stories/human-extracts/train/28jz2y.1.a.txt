My SO at the time had been depressed/suicidal and I had been making posts in relevant subs with a different account asking for advice.  A close friend of mine who uses Reddit pretty heavily saw one of the posts and figured out it was me because I had shared some of the details with him.  I was surprised/embarrassed at first that I had been so obvious, but it ended up being good because I got to confide in him about my situation, which is all I really wanted to do.
