Some buddies and I attended the high school graduation of a friend a year after we had graduated.  After one of the names was called, a great amount of whooping and hooting was heard from a few rows behind us.  I leaned over to my friend and said, "They sound like a bunch of monkeys!  " Of course the family causing the ruckus turned out to be black.
