Trying to do something nice, I said yes and tossed the check as soon as she left and opened the register to put my own money in.  My boss then walks in and sees me with the register open, money in my hand, and no customer.  She bitches at me for stealing money and throws in a "You can never trust a foreigner with money" (I'm Pakistani, btw).
