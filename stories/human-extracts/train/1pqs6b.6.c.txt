His truck wasn't all that powerful, so he usually had to stick it into a really low gear and crawl up the hills.  My great uncle had an idea for a prank and had my grandfather take the wheel while he jumped out of the cab.  When my uncle's friend passed them, my uncle was behind the truck, pushing it up the hill.
