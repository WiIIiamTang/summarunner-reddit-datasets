A buddy of mine I was working with and I started our closing duties a little early since the store was pretty dead that night in order to be able to leave at a reasonable hour.  He's looking around and everything seems to be in order until he looks behind some signage on a shelf and runs his finger through picking up some dust.  He has this shit eating grin on his face and lets out a little weasely laugh and says "Looks like you guys still have some work to do.  " My buddy and I looked at eachother and we both just knew what had to be done.  We cleaned the entire department top to bottom, inside and out.  Midnight turned into 2am and we were still going at it when he finally came out of the office red eyed and exhausted and said "Guys, let's go.  " "But we still haven't dusted under the counters and..." "Its fine, lets go.  Every time he was the closing manager after that night he never gave us trouble again, simply asking us if we were ready to go when the store closed.
