Used to work for Walmart, not once did a good deed go unpunished.  If ever I found a wallet/purse i would carry it by the corner at arms length, and open it looking for an ID while under a camera (still keeping it at arms length).  That way when they accused me of stealing (which I never would) there was plenty of vidoe coverage to protect me.
