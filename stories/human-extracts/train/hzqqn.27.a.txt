The flight out was fine, but on the way back they confiscated a teeny, tiny spray bottle of eye-glass cleaner from my carry-on luggage.  The flight was uneventful, and when I got home that night I unpacked my backpack completely to find that I had left a pack of matches in there from my *last* trip.
