I was at the corner store and the family in front of me had a case of beer, a 12-pack of Coke, a few packs of cigarettes, chicken nuggets, macaroni and cheese, and some milk.  Finally got approved, so they were going home with beer, Coke, and cigs.  Their two kids, maybe 4 and 6, asked what they were having for dinner if they didn't have the chicken nuggets.
