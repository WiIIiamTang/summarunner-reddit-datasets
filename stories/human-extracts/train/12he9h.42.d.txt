I went in grudgingly because it was very busy and touristy AND there was one particular "barrista" that fucking enraged me.  He was the most self-righteous, put-out, indignant, huffy little fuck to ever stand behind a coffee machine.  Fast forward a few weeks, in a different Starbucks, and I notice that they've begun to use stamp cards (10 stamps and the next coffee is free).  So as I'm leaving, I swipe the official Starbucks stamp from the counter... and proceed to stamp HUNDREDS of cards that summer.
