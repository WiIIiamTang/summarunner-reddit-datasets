An elderly lady was crossing the street and was hit by a guy on a scooter.  A man nearby saw what happened and came over to help her up and offered to take her to a hospital.  The old lady freaked out and started accusing the man of hitting her which he didnt.  She pressed charges and took him to court and it was a media frenzy in China.
