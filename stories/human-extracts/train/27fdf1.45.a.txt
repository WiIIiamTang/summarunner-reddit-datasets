When I was in middle school my friends and I were hanging out on a trampoline in the backyard late at night maybe like 11 pm or so.  Some guy comes through and asks if we have seen a little orange tabby cat and we told him no.  No joke, 2 min after this guy leaves this little car wanders through and we think "is that the cat he was talking about?  " My friend grabs it and we all proudly march to the guys house to collect our reward.  He's so excited and says "Oh I have the reward inside just come in and I'll give it to you.  He says "oh if you don't come in I can only give the reward to the ones that come in" He was gonna give us $100 a person to go in.
