I was driving back home to Los Angeles with a friend of mine after visiting family near Phoenix, AZ.  It was night and we were jamming out to some music.  The next thing I know I'm waking up, looking around and realizing that I was pulled over on the side of the road and that aproximately 3 hours had passed.
