I went out of town for my best friends wedding in which I was a bridesmaid.  Come home to find my blinds torn, DVD player smashed, cooking oil spilled all over my kitchen floor (that HE made me clean up because apparently it was my fault he knocked it over while I wasn't even in town) and my entire nail polish collection (over 50 colors) destroyed, I'm still finding cracked bottles, it's amazing how I haven't died from all those fumes.  He didnt apologize for any of it, his only words were "you made me do it.
