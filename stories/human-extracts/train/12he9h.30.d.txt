A long time ago I lent an asshole kid I knew $40.  So I let this kid get really drunk at the strip club.  Finally, when we get to the cheap hotel, when this little shit is probably a couple of Bud Lights away from straight-up alcohol poisoning, and is too drunk to even wake up to get out of the car, I take his wallet and find $65 in it.
