One day a girl called to ask if I could email her pictures of one of our apartments because she was currently in a different city.  Two days later I was able to get one of the leasing agents to take the pictures she requested (we had to get the current tenant's permission first) and I emailed them to her, reminding her she would need to visit before signing the lease.  She then asked to speak to my manager and shortly thereafter *faxed* over a written complaint about me and how horribly she had been misled and abused by me.
