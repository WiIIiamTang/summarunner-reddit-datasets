One time a lorry was supposed to be delivering a large amount of alcohol to a store in the middle of the Welsh valleys.  The motorway was shut though as there was a potential jumper on one of the bridges overhead.  Apparently it took 3 policemen to try and talk to guy off the ledge, and 20 police to hold back all the truckers who wanted to push him already.
