Anyway, every morning, there was so much commotion with all the tiny children hanging their over-sized backpacks on this cart that in that chaos, I would take the salami sandwich that was packed for me and would throw it into the cart.  There was a girl in our class, Victoria T. who would get picked on.  (*She was the smelly kid/she did stupid things for attention*) Naturally, all the kids blame her and with the rep she had, the teachers believed it.  She gets in trouble and though I feel bad, I realize that I can't say shit so I just join in to hide my guilt.
