When I was senior in high school, I chaperoned a middle school trip for my church, and for a few days everything went better than expected.  The day before we left my stomach started to feel a little queasy, but as I was not in a situation to deal with the problem, I gritted my teeth and waited.  Over an hour later I can finally access the bathroom, but i have some 100 yards between it and me.  I couldn't make it.  15 feet from the door everything went to hell.
