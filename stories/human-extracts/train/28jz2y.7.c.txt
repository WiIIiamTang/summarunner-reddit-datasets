On another account I had posted some pictures of myself to /r/gaybears.  About three weeks later I went to a party that my sister threw.  While I was there one of the older guys from her church, he's in his 50's, acted extremely weird around me at first.  Yeah... as we drove he suddenly blurted out "I saw your pictures.  I was wondering if.. uh... you wanted to get a beer sometime.
