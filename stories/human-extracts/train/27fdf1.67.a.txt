When I was eight or nine, my family took a trip with my dad to Toronto because he was going there for business.  We're at our table in the hotel cafe when this mid-thirties/early forties couple approaches us.  We saw the couple following us through a part of the mall.  Lo and behold the couple is at the pool as well!  They're sitting right across the pool from my mom just STARING at her.
