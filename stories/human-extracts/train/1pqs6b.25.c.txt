So I'm chugging along fully loaded on my way to the first store when I see what looked like a small bump, no big deal.  As I get closer I realize exactly how big this bump is and the fact that in reality it's a raised railroad track.  I swear to god when it was all said and done I managed to get at least 5 feet of air in that thing.
