I thought, "Hey, she might be my first girlfriend.  She approaches me and asks me to get her a blue-raspberry snow cone and then and only then could I be her boyfriend.  Just a few away from her my mind decides to shut down and I threw the snow cone at her.  Needless to say we were not boyfriend and girlfriend after this.
