I had a friend lose his phone in Ottawa/Gitineau after a night of drinking.  Fortunately a Good Samaritan had found it and answered our call.  Unfortunately one of our group had a bit too much to drink and grabbed the phone from Mr. Lost Phone and starts creaming into it "You fucking thief!  Phone Finder is not pleased and replies "You can pick your phone up at the bottom of the Rideau Canal" and hangs up.
