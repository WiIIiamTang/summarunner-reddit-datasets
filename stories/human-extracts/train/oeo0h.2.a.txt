After my initial message that I did leave (as quoted above) there was a slight pause and it continues on for another 30-40 seconds or so with me talking to some girl.  It was my voice, but a conversation I never had with a girl whose voice I didn't recognize.  Basically, in this conversation I was talking to this girl about going skiing but I had to go down to my shop and work on a car first, which totally correlated to me.  It was very freaky, I can't explain it.
