Struggling hard in med school being on call (fall 2000), I decided to do some quick shopping and grab a bite to eat.  My bro comes with.  I'M buying some thing from an electronic store, checking out... Then ... Can't find him.  Wait around... Getting pissed.  I'm so tired why would you waste my time!?  We get in, and he pulls out "Arcanum", a video game I was wanting.  Thought I'd surprise you with this when you got home.
