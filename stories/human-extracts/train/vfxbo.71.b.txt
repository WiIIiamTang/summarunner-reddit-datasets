I found a Gucci purse with $300 in it and an iphone on the street.  I returned the purse and phone with all contents intact to the hotel, they were surprised and asked for my contact if the guest wants to give me a gift.  I emailed her saying i already returned the purse to the hotel and the name of the employee who received it.  My gut was right, a few days later, the 'husband' emailed me with angry tone, he said he called the hotel and there was no employee with that name at that hotel and i should return the purse right away.
