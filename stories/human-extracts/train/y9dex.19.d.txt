I once flew into a foreign country for this woman's wedding since I was a bridesmaid.  The time I was there I witnessed her: shoving her daughter, starving and neglecting her pets, constantly fighting with her fiance, trying to control what I ate, accused me of stealing from her since I took a Pepsi from the refrigerator after they said to make myself at home, freaking out the night before as we were setting up because everything was wrong.
