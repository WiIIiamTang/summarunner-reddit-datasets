Found a dog wandering the road so I picked it up.  Turns out this office was about a 20 minute drive from me, and when I got there, they told me I couldn't leave the dog unless I paid for it to be treated with flea meds and paid for a night of boarding.  Nope, and they wouldn't let me leave the dog without paying.
