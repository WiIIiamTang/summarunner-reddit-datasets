When i was a kid growing up in philippines, i developed childhood asthma due to the heavy pollution.  I dont know how the idea came about, but my grandma in the province kept alot of stray cats so they cut off two ears of a cat, grilled it and fed it to me.  there's one cat with both of its ear flap cut off and a couple more with a left or right ear flap missing with the exception of one cat having both ear flaps.
