I use to work for a tent company and we would set up for weddings.  It was 95 degrees out, middle of July, and we were all suffering.  She was all nice and calm, said that she would buy us all lunch (6 or 7 guys) at around noon to thank us for our hard work.  She also said that she would bring us water since it was so hot out and we could tap into the keg when we were done.  We worked from 7 am to 11 pm at her house (not to mention the 45ish minute drive to and from her house).
