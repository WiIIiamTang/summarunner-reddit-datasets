I used to work at a place that sold used car batteries in a predominately black neighborhood.  Cue an older black gentleman walks in wanting to discuss his warranty and that his battery is bad.  There is no sticker so I say to him, "We can only warranty batteries the the 'White Power' label on them.  " He gets rather wide eyed and asks me "What kind of sticker" to which I reply again, "White powe.....Oh, Ummm one second.  He finishes his business, gets a new battery and tells the co worker he'd like to see me before he goes, I walk up still giggling like an idiot and he says to me "White Power my ni**a" And we shook hands and had a laugh about it.
