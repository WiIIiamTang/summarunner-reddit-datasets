When I was in college I quit my full-time summer job to work for a rich, psychotic acquaintance who attended my school.  He hired me to be his personal assistant, my boyfriend to be his personal chef, and one of my friends to be his "vice president.  He'd pay us to do things like watch TV with him, play touch football, or put on candles and music and have dinner laid out before he and his dates arrived home, so it looked like he had a butler.
