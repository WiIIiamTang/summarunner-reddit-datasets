I was hidden behind these bushes when I saw my neighbor's mini van run her down.  In the meantime I was breaking their sprinkler system and I sprinkled weed killer on their yard so the grass and flowers turned brown.  They had four cars and I broke all their windows and stole all their radios.  I carefully stuck nails into their yard by the ladder, by the recycling bin, and by the sprinkler timer so there would be a greater chance of one of them stepping onto the nails.  When they installed the new glass windows, I broke them again and set fire to the inside.  I should've left her body on their pillow to remind them of what they did.
