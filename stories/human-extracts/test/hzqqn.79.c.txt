Being only 6 years old, Id never done any kind of golfing before, so I only knew what Id always seen in movies or on TV: guys swinging it back and forth a few times before bringing it way back and up and then whacking the eff out of the ball.  The birthday boys older sister (maybe 13; also my babysitter) was standing pretty close behind me.  I whacked the *shit* out of her face.  She screamed, her nose bled everywhere and I think I may have broken it.
