It was around 1:30 or 2am and we were making our way down the road not really paying attention to much, and she suddenly grabs my arm and gasps (which freaked me out already).  As i'm looking around as to what the fuck is going on, we approach the roundabout and there is a man in medical looking attire next to a woman in what looked like white pyjamas, with blood covering a lot of her clothing.  I go straight, and as we go past the woman attempts to launch herself at my car as the man looked like he was trying to stop her.
