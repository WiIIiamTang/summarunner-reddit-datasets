Lady at work said she lost a wallet.  She was super excited until she asked if money was in it.  I told her no, because it wasn't there.  She instantly became suspicious and blamed the houseman who found it.  I had to stand up for a great guy and explain to her it was her fault for losing it in the first place and that he wouldn't do that.
