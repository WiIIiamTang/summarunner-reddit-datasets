My trainee and I were sent to a suicide call.  As the body rolls, the dead guy farts.  Let me preface this by saying I have smelled horrible things in my career: disgusting houses, gross people, gross people covered in poo, other, deader people....NOTHING compared to the dead guy fart.  I NOPE'd that, and made my partner and trainee handle the gassy guy.
