As a rookie, I got a call of a prowler cutting through someone's yard near a cemetery.  I'm shining lights all around and I finally see Chop standing next to fence, with a hole in it, leading into the cemetery.  I announce myself and Chop beings just screaming, starting at me with the rage of psychotic.
