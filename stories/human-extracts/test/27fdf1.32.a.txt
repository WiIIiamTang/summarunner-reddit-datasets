I was driving down the motorway with my boyfriend in the passenger seat, and my dad in the seat behind my own.  My dad is an epileptic and his fits are extremely sporadic.  Mid-conversation I felt his hands wrap around my throat as I was driving, pulling my head back and making it increasingly difficult to drive.
