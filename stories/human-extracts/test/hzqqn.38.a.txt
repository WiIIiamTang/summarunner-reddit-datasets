I was visiting a friend in Chicago and he decided to take me out for authentic mexican food the night before I left.  I pull into a parking space and start my sprint into HD with stomach at a level 4 meltdown and then it happens..... Me a grown fucking man......SHIT MYSELF.  I grabbed another old t shirt from my bag and cleaned my self up with that.  The smell was horrid in my car, no shit got on my seat but the smell was stuck in my car.
