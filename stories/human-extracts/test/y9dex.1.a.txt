I knew a woman who was a bridesmaid in a relatives wedding.  The bridezilla got furious and kicked her out of the wedding because she would be pregant in the pictures.  3 months later, sadly, the woman miscarried.  The bride called her with a response along the lines of "good, well now you can be back in the wedding.
