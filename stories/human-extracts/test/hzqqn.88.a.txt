I heard this one from a stand-up comic guy (can't remember his name), but it's one of those "what in the fucking fuck" stories.  So the ambulance showed up, and the EMT actually had to partially put his hand inside of the woman's vagina to keep the baby's head from laying wrong and getting complications.  So the doctor performs the c-section and the baby comes out of her stomach, and then the doctor REACHES INSIDE THE MOTHER and shakes the EMT's hand while still inside her vagina for a job well done.
