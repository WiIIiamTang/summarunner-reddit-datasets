My mom found a phone in the middle of a car park near an Ikea.  She then calls multiple times asking me to come somewhere closer to where she currently is, which is inconvenient as fuck for me, as I wasn't able to drive or get around town without paying for bus/train tickets, so I tell her I can't do that.  She gets out of the car, grabs the phone, barks an angry "thanks" and gets back in the car and drives off.
