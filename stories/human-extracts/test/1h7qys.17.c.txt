When I was 15 and working at a summer camp, I was asked to remove a bench from the lake shore.  It wasn't until 30 seconds later that I looked down and noticed blood **POURING** out of my ring finger.  It turned out that the concrete that slipped had caught my finger against the edge of the dumpster and quite literally smashed it off at the first knuckle.
