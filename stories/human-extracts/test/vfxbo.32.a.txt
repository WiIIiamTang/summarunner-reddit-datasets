A little boy of about 3 left his mother and was running into the crowded food court... and it was Black Friday in my low-income area, so there were a LOT of fucking people.  I yelled for his mom but she was in the dressing room, so I ran out and grabbed him before he could get lost in the crowd of people.  When I walked back in the store the woman charged at me (as I explained that he had run out of the store, there was no way she didn't know what I was doing), took the kid out of my hands, grabbed my ponytail, got in my face, and screamed at me for touching her son.
