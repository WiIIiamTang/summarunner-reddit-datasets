The highlight of my grandmother's sermon after she found out I was gay was to say ''I don't believe you're actually a homosexual. If you're telling me you are, and refuse to be wrong, then I will go out in the back yard, get a large stick, shove it up your asshole, and you can tell me how much you enjoy it. ''
